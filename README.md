# Joint 2D-3D segmentation 
The Joint 2D-3D segmentation algorithm is developed for the Automated Lesion Segmentation in Whole-Body FDG-PET/CT Challenge (AutoPET 2022). This repository includes codes and trained model weights submitted to the challenge. The model is built upon nnUNet (https://github.com/MIC-DKFZ/nnunet).
